/* Stamps a build id onto every local css/js URL in www/index.html.

   Two things make a rebuilt Capacitor app keep showing the previous version,
   and one stamp defeats both:

   - WKWebView caches by URL, and installing over an app does not clear its
     data container, so the webview happily re-serves the stylesheet it read
     last time. A new query string is a new URL, so there is nothing to hit.
   - Xcode treats App/public as a folder reference and skips re-copying it
     when it looks unchanged (the symptom is a "Build succeeded" that takes
     half a second). Rewriting index.html every build gives it something it
     cannot skip.

   Only the built copy under www/ is touched; the source index.html stays
   clean, so the plain web build is unaffected. */
