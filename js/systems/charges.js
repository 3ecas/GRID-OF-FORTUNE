   CHARGES
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Two dials either side of the hand. Both fill, both are spent by pressing
   them, and that is where the similarity ends — what feeds them is the point.

     star   fills on chains.  Only a merge that sets off another one pays, and
                              the deeper the chain the more it pays. Spending
                              one owes the board a sweep: pick a piece and every
                              one of them goes.
     bomb   fills on merges.  Any merge at all, one for one. Spending one puts a
                              stick of dynamite in your hand to place.

   So the bomb is the wage for showing up and the star is the bonus for playing
   well. A run of ordinary merges keeps the bomb coming; only a chain moves the
   star, which makes the star something you set up rather than something that
   accumulates.

   Both count things rather than points, and that is the whole trick. Points
   inflate — a merge at diamond is worth thousands of times a merge at dirt, and
   worse, a placement late in a run sets off cascades that score several merges
   at once. Pricing a dial in points meant it arrived every 22 moves early on
   and every 6 moves late, which is the opposite of a cost. Counted this way,
   both dials cost the same amount of play wherever you are on the ladder.
